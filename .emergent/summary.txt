The AI engineer successfully transformed a conversational AI Crypto Trading Coach MVP into a sophisticated automated trading system. This involved adopting a three-tier architecture: Frontend, Backend Orchestrator, and a Freqtrade-inspired Trading Bot. Initial challenges included UI inconsistencies, API quota issues, and a persistent timestamp discrepancy. The core development focused on building out the trading bot, scaffolding a backend to control it, and integrating a frontend cockpit. A critical pivot occurred in Phase 5, where the engineer initially misapplied Google Gemini for real-time trading signals, but swiftly corrected course to integrate the actual FreqAI module for high-speed predictions, relegating Gemini to future strategic intelligence. The system now boasts trained FreqAI models (up to 78.7% accuracy), comprehensive risk management, and a functional UI. Current efforts are concentrated on resolving 3 remaining backend test failures, specifically addressing a BTC/ZAR data issue and an RSI function parameter error.

<product_requirements>
The goal is an AI Crypto Trading Coach to achieve R100,000 monthly profit via daily strategies and weekly cash-outs. Key features include real-time Luno portfolio analysis (with staked assets, ZAR conversion), risk management, and conversational AI. The application requires secure login with Google 2FA, AI-driven portfolio/goal analysis post-login, AI web research, concise AI responses, auto-scrolling chat, persistent conversation memory (session forking), targeted trading campaigns, dynamic dashboard updates with AI-adjusted metrics, daily AI memory consolidation, and semi-automatic trading with user approval. The AI should default to concise responses, display dynamic targets, show accurate local timezone timestamps, and provide full portfolio data without automatic target adjustments. Recent additions included a Freqtrade-inspired backtesting system with simulation mode and planned live trading. The UI must maintain a consistent black/turquoise color scheme. Future integration with TikTok for market indicators is also anticipated.

<code_architecture>

**High-Level Architecture:** The application follows a three-tier architecture: **Frontend Cockpit** (React) ↔ **Backend Orchestrator** (FastAPI) ↔ **Trading Bot** (Custom Freqtrade-style with FreqAI). MongoDB serves as the database for the backend, while the trading bot integrates with Luno API. Google Gemini is planned for strategic intelligence.

**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Main FastAPI application. Critical for integrating new services (, ) and adding new API endpoints (, , ). CORS middleware was updated to include the frontend's public IP. Authentication endpoints were reordered to resolve Not Found errors.
-   : **NEW**. This service acts as the communication layer between the main Backend Orchestrator and the independent Trading Bot, handling HTTP requests for bot control and data.
-   : **NEW**. Manages user-defined financial targets, tracks progress, and allows for auto-adjustment, persisting this data in MongoDB.
-   : Core UI dashboard. Significantly modified to include a new Bot Control tab (now the 8th tab). It incorporates UI elements for real-time bot status, controls (Start/Stop), performance metrics, and target progress visualization. Color scheme references were extensively refactored from amber to cyan to ensure consistency.
-   : User authentication component. Despite a replacement and code changes to apply cyan colors, it was still reported as visually amber/gold, indicating a persistent styling issue.
-   : **NEW**. This is the custom-built, Freqtrade-inspired trading bot. It encapsulates the core trading logic, risk management, and strategy execution. It exposes a FastAPI API for external control (by the Backend Orchestrator) and integrates the  for machine learning predictions. It was reconfigured to run on port 8082 to avoid conflicts.
-   : **NEW**. Defines the trading strategy that leverages FreqAI's machine learning predictions for entry and exit signals, incorporating features like RSI, MACD, and EMA.
-   : **NEW**. This service within the custom trading bot is responsible for handling the actual FreqAI machine learning pipeline: feature engineering, model training (RandomForest), and making real-time predictions. It addresses the geographical limitations for data download by using locally generated sample data.
-   : **NEW**. Configuration file for the , defining trading parameters, risk management, pairs, and FreqAI settings. Updated to remove problematic Telegram settings and specify local data usage.
-   : Updated to include the  for future Gemini integration.
-   : **NEW**. Created to explicitly define  for production.
-    and : Modified to correctly define and apply the new cyan color palette via Shadcn/ui's custom property system.

<pending_tasks>
-   Resolve remaining 3 backend test failures (specifically BTC/ZAR FreqAI training and RSI function parameter error).
-   Fix persistent 2-hour timestamp discrepancy for AI messages in the UI.
-   Implement TikTok integration for social sentiment analysis (future Phase 6 task).
-   Resolve persistent amber/gold colors on the login page ().
-   Fix WebSocket connection issues ().
-   Coordinate with the user to open Port 8001 in the cloud provider's firewall.
-   Diagnose and optimize Gemini API problems causing timeouts and non-responsiveness (for strategic intelligence).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully completed Phases 1 through 5 of the development plan, establishing a three-tier AI Crypto Trading Coach system. This includes a fully functional React frontend, a FastAPI backend orchestrator, and a Freqtrade-inspired trading bot with integrated FreqAI for real-time machine learning predictions. The system now supports bot control, real-time performance monitoring, and target tracking through the frontend.

The most recent focus, prompted by user feedback, is on resolving the **3 remaining backend test failures** (out of 18 tests, resulting in an 83.3% success rate). The AI engineer has just run a deep diagnostic, and has identified two specific issues contributing to these failures:
1.  **FreqAI BTC/ZAR Prediction Failure**: The BTC/ZAR model failed to train because the BTCZAR symbol is not recognized by the Luno exchange in the current data setup.
2.  **RSI Function Parameter Error**: An  function is receiving an unexpected  parameter, leading to an error.

The engineer is currently in the process of implementing fixes for these two identified problems, aiming to achieve 100% backend test pass rate before proceeding to Phase 6 (Google Gemini strategic intelligence).
