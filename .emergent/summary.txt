The previous AI engineer successfully brought the AI Crypto Trading Coach application from MVP to a feature-rich, functional state. The trajectory showcases a systematic approach to addressing user requirements, starting with core functionalities like real-time data integration, AI coaching, and technical analysis. The engineer meticulously debugged complex issues, including JSON serialization for pandas data, frontend state management, and environment variable configurations. Critical enhancements included the implementation of a targeted trading campaign system, comprehensive security measures (API security, data protection), daily AI memory updates, and a semi-automatic trading approval system. The final interactions focused on building a robust secure login system with Google 2FA and AI-powered portfolio analysis upon login, culminating in the successful generation and delivery of a scannable QR code for 2FA setup. The process involved extensive code modifications across both frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI), with careful attention to user feedback and iterative refinement.

<product_requirements>
The user initially required an AI Crypto Trading Coach for personal speculation, aiming for R100,000 monthly profit. Core features included daily strategies, weekly cash-outs, real-time market/portfolio analysis (from Luno, converting USD to ZAR, including staked assets), risk management, and conversational AI. Initial design requests shifted to clinical and professional. Key iterations demanded accurate, real-time data (no mock data), AI web research, auto-trading capability, concise AI responses (no truncation/emojis), auto-scrolling chat, and persistent conversation memory. Later requests expanded to include a targeted trading campaign, dashboard updates for AI-adjusted metrics, daily AI memory consolidation, semi-automatic trading with user approval, robust database and backend security, and a secure login system with Google 2FA and AI-driven portfolio/goal analysis upon login. Recent explicit requests include AI defaulting to concise responses, displaying dynamic targets, accurate timestamps based on browser timezone, AI context retention via session forking, and complete portfolio data display (e.g., HBAR). The AI must not auto-adjust targets without explicit user request.

<code_architecture>


- ****: Stores backend environment variables. Updated with ADMIN_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET_KEY, and user's 2FA secret (TOTP_SECRET_KEY) for the login system.
- ****: Defines Pydantic models. Major additions for new features and secure login. Crucially, added  model for persistent conversation memory.
- ****: Main FastAPI application. Major additions for new endpoints, security middleware, and integration of new services. The  DELETE endpoint was modified to summarize the current conversation before deleting messages, enabling session forking. Timestamp handling was adjusted to ensure consistency.
- ****: Handles AI interactions. Enhanced to include  and . AI response formatting refined for conciseness unless details are explicitly requested. Fixed duplicate context building. Implemented session management to reuse  instances. Added a  method for conversation summarization and updated the AI's system message to leverage these summaries for context retention across forked sessions. Modified to actively use web search for market queries and dynamically include portfolio context based on user keywords.
- ****: Manages Luno API interactions. Expanded to fetch all assets, including staked ones. Critically, implemented cross-conversion logic () in  to ensure all assets (e.g., HBAR) are valued in ZAR, even if Luno doesn't offer a direct ZAR trading pair for them, by using bridge currencies like USD.
- ****: New service for market data, technical analysis ( library), and trading signals.
- ****: New service to manage and load AI knowledge from markdown files.
- ** (NEW)**: Manages targeted trading campaigns.
- ** (NEW)**: Handles daily AI memory consolidation and retrieval.
- ** (NEW)**: Manages semi-automatic trading operations.
- ** (NEW)**: Provides core security functionalities.
- ** (NEW)**: Implements logging and monitoring for security events.
- ** (NEW)**: Handles user registration, login, JWT token generation, and 2FA (TOTP) management.
- ****: Main React application file. Integrated the  component.
- ****: Core component for the AI Crypto Trader Coach dashboard. Transitioned to real-time data, refined UI/UX. Added Technical and Campaigns tabs. Removed hardcoded targets, using dynamic state variables. The problematic automatic target adjustment logic triggered by AI keywords was removed. The New Session button was renamed Fork Session and its behavior updated to clear the UI while signaling the backend to summarize and retain context. All timestamp creation and display logic was refined to use a single  object and  for consistent local timezone display across all messages (user and AI).
- ** (NEW)**: Primary React component for user login, including 2FA input.
- ****: HTML template. Removed Emergent branding.
- ** (NEW)**: Simple HTML page to display the generated 2FA QR code.

<pending_tasks>
- The timestamp consistency issue persists. Despite multiple attempts to standardize timestamps to UTC and display them consistently in the user's local timezone on the frontend, the user still reports a 2-hour discrepancy between their message timestamps and AI response timestamps. This requires further investigation and a definitive fix.

<current_work>
The AI Crypto Trading Coach application is fully functional, offering real-time market data, technical analysis, AI-powered coaching, and targeted trading campaign management. A secure login system with Google 2FA for the user Henrijc is operational, integrating AI-driven portfolio analysis immediately upon login.

**Key refinements recently implemented include:**
1.  **AI Response Conciseness**: The AI now defaults to concise responses and only provides detailed portfolio analysis when explicitly requested by the user, avoiding unsolicited verbose outputs.
2.  **Dynamic Targets**: The dashboard now displays dynamically updated monthly and weekly targets fetched from the backend, eliminating previously hardcoded values. The AI no longer auto-adjusts targets based on keywords but only upon explicit user commands.
3.  **HBAR Data Integration**: The system successfully fetches and includes HBAR holdings in the portfolio breakdown, providing accurate ZAR valuation even when Luno does not offer a direct HBAR/ZAR trading pair, by employing cross-currency conversion (e.g., HBAR/USD to USD/ZAR).
4.  **Session Forking**: A sophisticated Fork Session mechanism has been implemented. When activated, the AI summarizes the current conversation's key points (goals, decisions), saves this summary to a persistent database collection, clears the frontend chat UI for a clean slate, and deletes the old chat messages. This ensures the AI retains conversational memory from past summaries (forked sessions) while providing a fresh user interface. The AI's welcome message upon a forked session now intelligently references previous discussions and goals based on these summaries.

**Current Nuances**: While many critical issues have been resolved, the timestamp consistency issue (a 2-hour difference between user and AI message display times) remains, as reported by the user, despite multiple attempts to fix it. The AI currently claims the timestamps are fixed, but the user's last feedback indicates otherwise.

<optional_next_step>
Thoroughly re-investigate and fix the persistent 2-hour timestamp discrepancy between user and AI messages in the frontend.
