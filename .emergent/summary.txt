The previous AI engineer successfully brought the AI Crypto Trading Coach application to a fully functional state. The trajectory began with the engineer confirming the initial build (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB) and focusing on Luno API integration and UI refinement. Key work phases involved implementing a Technical Analysis Engine, which required extensive debugging of JSON serialization issues with pandas data. Concurrently, the AI addressed user complaints regarding data accuracy, fixing critical frontend rendering issues related to state management and environment variable configuration (specifically, the backend URL for API calls). Finally, the AI improved conversation persistence by using  for  and enhanced AI responses by providing real-time portfolio and market context, and adjusting AI system prompts and token limits. The Emergent branding was also removed as requested. The final message from the AI claims the application is fully functional, with real-time data and UI issues resolved.

<product_requirements>
The user required an AI Crypto Trading Coach application to assist with crypto speculation, aiming for R100,000 monthly earnings. Key features include daily trading strategies, weekly cash-out targets, real-time market analysis, risk management advice, and portfolio analysis. The AI should be conversational, use real-time market data from Luno, and allow users to choose specific cryptocurrencies. The application is for personal use, requiring user authentication and saved progress, and a single-page interface. Throughout development, the user iterated on design, requesting a black and gold/rose gold theme with Tron and AC/DC aesthetics, then shifting to a clinical and professional minimalist design. Critical requirements emerged for accurate, real-time data (no mock data, USD pair conversion for non-ZAR assets), full detection of all user assets including staked ones, AI web research capabilities, and the ability to auto-trade with user-defined instructions. The AI's responses also needed to be concise, clear, and professional, devoid of excessive formatting or emojis, with an auto-scrolling chat interface and persistent conversation memory.

- ** (NEW)**:
    - **Summary**: New service responsible for fetching market data, performing technical analysis (using  library), and generating trading signals/recommendations.
    - **Changes**: Created to encapsulate technical analysis logic. Initially attempted CoinGecko for historical data but switched to Luno market data due to issues. Implemented logic to handle and clean NaN/infinity values for JSON serialization.

- ** (NEW)**:
    - **Summary**: New service to manage and load additional AI knowledge from structured markdown/text files.
    - **Changes**: Created to load knowledge files from a new  directory.

- ** (NEW FOLDER)**:
    - **Summary**: New directory structure to store categorized AI knowledge base files. Includes subfolders like , , , , , .
    - **Changes**: Created along with example  files.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Main React application file, sets up routing.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Core component for the AI Crypto Trader Coach dashboard.
    - **Changes**:
        - **Data Integration**: Transitioned from mock data to real-time data from backend APIs (portfolio, market, technical analysis).
        - **UI/UX**: Refined to a clinical and professional aesthetic; auto-scrolling chat.
        - **Technical Analysis Integration**: Added a Technical tab, UI for displaying market overview, specific symbol indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands), trend, and recommendations.
        - **Data Loading Fixes**: Implemented sequential data loading with loading states, used  for , and added detailed debugging logs.
        - **Chat Persistence**: Modified  generation to use  for persistence across page loads.
        - **AI Context**:  updated to include  and  context in API calls to the AI.

<pending_tasks>
- No explicitly pending tasks from previous user requests that were not addressed by the AI. All requested features and reported bugs (Technical Analysis Engine, branding removal, data accuracy/UI display, AI conversational memory/context) have been addressed and are claimed to be fully functional.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI Crypto Trading Coach application is currently in a fully functional state, with all major features implemented and critical bugs resolved as claimed by the AI.

**Frontend State:**
- The React frontend successfully displays real-time **Live Market Data** for 17 cryptocurrencies, including prices and 24-hour changes.
- The **Portfolio Value** (e.g., R 155,091.83) is now accurately displayed in the header, resolving previous R 0.00 issues.
- The **Monthly Target Progress** and **Weekly Performance** sections are calculating and displaying correctly, including the progress bar.
- A dedicated **Technical Analysis tab** is fully integrated, showing a market overview with trends, RSI, recommendations, and detailed indicators for selected symbols (e.g., BTC, ETH, ADA).
- The chat interface now maintains **conversation persistence** across page loads using  for .
- All Emergent branding has been successfully removed, resulting in a clean AI Trading Coach interface.

**Backend State:**
- The FastAPI backend provides all necessary API endpoints for real-time data from Luno, AI coaching (Google Gemini), target management, auto-trading, and now **Technical Analysis** and a dynamic **AI Knowledge Base**.
- The Technical Analysis Engine leverages the  Python library to generate indicators and signals, handling  and  values for proper JSON serialization.
- The AI service now receives comprehensive **real-time portfolio and market context** with each user message, enabling it to provide more intelligent and relevant responses without asking for information it already possesses.
- A new **AI Knowledge Base** system allows for loading additional training data (markdown/text files) from a categorized folder structure (), which the AI automatically incorporates into its responses.

**Current Nuances/Knowns:**
- The application underwent extensive debugging related to:
    - Frontend-backend communication (resolving API URL issues, including caching of  variables).
    - React state management and re-rendering, especially for dynamically loaded data.
    - Python object serialization (MongoDB ObjectId, pandas NaN/infinity values).
    - AI's conversational flow, including truncation, context awareness, and general response quality.
- The last fix ensured correct local network routing for frontend API calls to the backend, enabling full data display. The AI believes this has resolved all critical UI display issues.
