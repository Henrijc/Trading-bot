The AI engineer's journey focused primarily on establishing a robust CI/CD pipeline and resolving persistent deployment issues for the AI Crypto Trading Coach. Initially, the system struggled with ,  compilation, and  misconfigurations, even leading to a broken live website. Key architectural decisions included a shift to a release-based deployment model, adopting a copy entire project Docker strategy, and setting .

Significant challenges involved debugging SSH authentication failures for CI/CD, inconsistent Python import paths ( vs. ), missing  files, incorrect  file handling, and unaddressed external dependencies like . The work progressed through iterative debugging, including aggressive cache clearing, manual file creation on the VPS, and eventually pinpointing the exact lines of code with faulty imports and uninstalled Python packages. The SSH issues led to a temporary pivot to manual deployment via provided password, while core code fixes were consolidated in the source. The work culminated in identifying the last few critical import and dependency issues within specific files.

<product_requirements>
The AI Crypto Trading Coach is an AI-driven system aiming for R100,000 monthly profit. It features daily AI strategies, weekly cash-outs, real-time Luno portfolio analysis, robust risk management, and a conversational AI interface. Key functionalities include Google 2FA, AI-driven portfolio/goal analysis, AI web research, concise AI responses, auto-scrolling chat, persistent conversation memory with session forking, targeted trading campaigns, dynamic dashboard updates, and semi-automatic trading requiring user approval. The UI uses a black/cyan color scheme, dynamic targets, accurate local timezone timestamps, and full portfolio data. Recent enhancements include Freqtrade-inspired backtesting (simulation mode) and live trading, alongside a fully implemented AI Decision Engine. The primary development focus has been on robust deployment via a standalone Docker package and a CI/CD pipeline for VPS deployment. Future plans involve Google Gemini and TikTok integrations.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a three-tier architecture: Frontend Cockpit (React) ↔ Backend Orchestrator (FastAPI) ↔ Trading Bot (Custom Freqtrade-style with FreqAI). MongoDB is the database. The deployment strategy has been re-architected multiple times and currently employs a release-based model using GitHub Container Registry, with a new copy entire project into container Docker strategy.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical debugging phase for the AI Crypto Trading Coach, primarily addressing persistent  issues impacting the backend and freqtrade services upon deployment to the VPS.

The most recent work involved:
1.  **Diagnosing Container Restart Loop:** After resolving initial  file warnings and rebuilding containers, the backend and freqtrade services continued to restart due to import errors.
2.  **Pinpointing Specific ModuleNotFoundErrors:** Detailed testing inside the  container revealed:
    *   : This indicates that certain imports within  were still using relative paths like  instead of the required absolute paths .
    *   Freqtrade logs showed : This indicated a missing Python dependency for the  module, which  imports.
3.  **Proposed Fixes:** The AI engineer has identified the exact lines in  (lines 1522 and 1674, likely within internal function scopes) that need to be updated with the correct absolute import path (). Additionally,  was identified as a missing dependency for , which needs to be added to . The plan is to clean up  and then rebuild the  and  containers.

The state is that most fundamental deployment issues (SSH,  files, base Dockerfile setups,  presence) have been addressed, and the problem has been narrowed down to a few precise Python import path errors and one missing Python package.
