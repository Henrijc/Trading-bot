<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully brought the AI Crypto Trading Coach application from MVP to a feature-rich, functional state. The trajectory showcases a systematic approach to addressing user requirements, starting with core functionalities like real-time data integration, AI coaching, and technical analysis. The engineer meticulously debugged complex issues, including JSON serialization for pandas data, frontend state management, and environment variable configurations. Critical enhancements included the implementation of a targeted trading campaign system, comprehensive security measures (API security, data protection), daily AI memory updates, and a semi-automatic trading approval system. The final interactions focused on building a robust secure login system with Google 2FA and AI-powered portfolio analysis upon login, culminating in the successful generation and delivery of a scannable QR code for 2FA setup. The process involved extensive code modifications across both frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI), with careful attention to user feedback and iterative refinement.

<product_requirements>
The user initially required an AI Crypto Trading Coach for personal speculation, aiming for R100,000 monthly profit. Core features included daily strategies, weekly cash-outs, real-time market/portfolio analysis (from Luno, converting USD to ZAR, including staked assets), risk management, and conversational AI. Initial design requests for black and gold/Tron/AC/DC shifted to clinical and professional. Key iterations demanded accurate, real-time data (no mock data), AI web research, auto-trading capability, concise AI responses (no truncation/emojis), auto-scrolling chat, and persistent conversation memory. Later requests expanded to include a R10k to R10k in a week targeted trading campaign, dashboard updates for AI-adjusted metrics, daily AI memory consolidation, semi-automatic trading with user approval (not full autonomy), robust database and backend security, and a secure login system with Google 2FA and AI-driven portfolio/goal analysis upon login.

<current_work>
The AI Crypto Trading Coach application is fully functional, with a comprehensive suite of features addressing user requirements for an advanced trading assistant.

**Recently Completed Work (Secure Login & 2FA with AI Analysis):**
The most recent major feature implemented is a **secure login system** for the user Henrijc with **Google 2FA (TOTP)** and integrated **AI-powered portfolio analysis** upon login.
1.  **Backend Implementation**: An  was created to handle user registration, login (with password hashing using bcrypt), JWT token generation, and TOTP secret generation (). This service was integrated into  with dedicated authentication endpoints (, ).
2.  **Frontend Integration**: A  component was developed and integrated into  to provide the user interface for login. This component handles username, password, and 2FA code input.
3.  **AI Login Analysis**: The AI service was enhanced to perform a real-time analysis of the user's portfolio, market conditions, and target progress immediately upon successful login, providing an instant briefing and recommendations.
4.  **2FA Setup**: The system was configured to generate a unique TOTP secret for the user Henrijc. Initially, the secret was displayed as plain text and the QR code as base64 text directly in the chat, which was not scannable.
5.  **QR Code Fix**: To resolve the scannability issue, the AI removed sensitive login details from the display, and critically, generated a proper scannable QR code. This QR code was then embedded into a simple HTML page (), which was served temporarily by a local web server to ensure it was visually rendered and scannable for the user's Google Authenticator app.

**Current State & Nuances:**
-   The login interface is now clean and functional, awaiting the user to scan the provided QR code and log in.
-   The user's account (Henrijc with password H3nj3n) is configured with Google 2FA.
-   Backup recovery codes have been provided to the user.
-   The backend's authentication, security, and AI analysis on login endpoints are verified as working.
-   The core application features (real-time market data, portfolio value, technical analysis, AI coaching, targeted trading campaigns, daily AI memory, semi-automatic trading) are reported as fully functional and tested.

<optional_next_step>
Guide the user to scan the provided QR code with Google Authenticator and then proceed to log into the application at http://localhost:3000 to experience the AI portfolio analysis.
