<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built an AI Crypto Trading Coach from scratch. The initial phase focused on a mock-data React frontend, followed by a FastAPI backend with MongoDB. A significant portion of the trajectory involved debugging Luno API integration and environment variable loading issues, ensuring real-time crypto data and portfolio analysis. Concurrently, the AI iteratively refined the UI/UX based on user feedback, transitioning from a basic template to a Tron and AC/DC inspired design, then to a clinical and professional look. Key features like dynamic target adjustment, full asset detection (including staked assets), web research for the AI, and a configurable auto-trading system were implemented. The AI's communication style was also refined for clarity and professionalism. The final interaction explores advanced features, with a recommendation for a Technical Analysis Engine.

<product_requirements>
The user required an AI Crypto Trading Coach application to assist with crypto speculation, aiming for R100,000 monthly earnings. Key features include daily trading strategies, weekly cash-out targets, real-time market analysis, risk management advice, and portfolio analysis. The AI should be conversational, use real-time market data from Luno, and allow users to choose specific cryptocurrencies. The application is for personal use, requiring user authentication and saved progress, and a single-page interface.

Throughout development, the user iterated on design, requesting a black and gold/rose gold theme with Tron and AC/DC aesthetics, then shifting to a clinical and professional minimalist design. Critical requirements emerged for accurate, real-time data (no mock data, USD pair conversion for non-ZAR assets), full detection of all user assets including staked ones, AI web research capabilities, and the ability to auto-trade with user-defined instructions (max trade amount, daily limit, stop loss, take profit, trading hours, allowed assets). The AI's responses also needed to be concise, clear, and professional, devoid of excessive formatting or emojis, with an auto-scrolling chat interface.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: The main FastAPI application entry point, handling API routing, CORS, and database connection.
    - **Changes**: Modified to properly load environment variables, register  with a  prefix, and include new endpoints for status checks, AI chat, target management, Luno data, and auto-trading. Debugged  placement to ensure services access correct environment variables.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Contains the logic for AI interactions, including chat processing, web research, and target adjustment.
    - **Changes**: Updated to improve AI response formatting (less emojis, less bolding, more concise), integrate web search (DuckDuckGo, CoinGecko, News API), and implement target adjustment logic. Also includes functionality for processing auto-trading instructions.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: Handles all interactions with the Luno API, fetching market data, portfolio holdings, and executing trades.
    - **Changes**: Initially set up for basic Luno calls. Significantly expanded to fetch all assets, handle staked assets, convert USD pairs to ZAR using estimated prices, and implement trading functionalities (market/limit orders). Repeatedly debugged for  errors related to environment variable loading and datetime serialization.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: The main React application file, setting up routing and initial API calls.
    - **Changes**: Updated to integrate  and  for navigation. The  component was replaced by  as the main application view. Emergent branding (image and text) was removed.

- ****:
    - **Summary**: The core component for the AI Crypto Trader Coach dashboard and chat interface.
    - **Changes**:
        - **Initial**: Built as a mock-data-driven UI with dashboard, portfolio, strategy, risk management sections, and a chat interface.
        - **Mock data removal**: Modified to fetch real data from the backend.
        - **Design**: Iteratively updated to implement black and gold/rose gold (Tron/ACDC) theme, then refined to a clinical and professional aesthetic, including styling adjustments and removal of emojis/flashy graphics.
        - **Responsiveness**: Improved for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
        - **AI chat**: Enhanced for better display of formatted AI responses and auto-scrolling functionality.

<current_work>
The AI Crypto Trading Coach application is a fully functional full-stack MVP.
**Frontend:** Developed with React, it features a dynamic dashboard displaying real-time portfolio overview, market data (from Luno API, including USD to ZAR conversions for non-ZAR pairs via CoinGecko), and monthly/weekly progress towards a financial target. It includes four main sections: Overview, Portfolio, Strategy, and Risk Management. The UI has been refined to a clinical and professional aesthetic, emphasizing readability and structured data presentation, with all previous flashy graphics, emojis, and Emergent branding removed. The chat interface now auto-scrolls to new messages and displays AI responses in a clear, concise, and professional tone.
**Backend:** Built with FastAPI and MongoDB, it provides API endpoints for:
    - **AI Coaching**: Integrated with Google Gemini, capable of web research (DuckDuckGo, CoinGecko, News API) for market analysis and context-aware trading advice.
    - **Real-time Data**: Connects directly to the Luno API using provided credentials to fetch live market prices and user's actual portfolio holdings (including detection of staked assets like SOL, ADA, ETH, and multiple accounts).
    - **Target Management**: AI can dynamically adjust financial targets based on user performance and market conditions, with these changes reflecting on the dashboard.
    - **Auto Trading**: A configurable system allows the user to set parameters like maximum trade amount, daily limit, stop loss, take profit, trading hours, and allowed assets for automated trade execution on Luno.
    - **Chat History**: Persistent storage of chat interactions in MongoDB.
**Current State**: The application is fully operational with live data, comprehensive asset tracking (R156,546.06 portfolio value), intelligent AI coaching, and user-controlled auto-trading capabilities. The AI's personality has been adjusted to be helpful and professional.
