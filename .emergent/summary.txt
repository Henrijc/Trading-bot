The previous AI engineer's primary focus was to stabilize the deployment of the AI Crypto Trading Coach, transitioning it from an MVP to a robust, automatically deployable system. Initial work established a three-tier React/FastAPI/Freqtrade architecture, leveraging MongoDB and FreqAI. The core challenge shifted from API stability to reliable CI/CD deployment on a VPS. The AI diagnosed recurring Docker build failures, initially attributed to  errors and later to a  error in the frontend Dockerfile. A  was consulted to resolve cache corruption. The AI believed it fixed the frontend Dockerfile by switching from npm <command>

Usage:

npm install        install all the dependencies in your project
npm install <foo>  add the <foo> dependency to your project
npm test           run this project's tests
npm run <foo>      run the script named <foo>
npm <command> -h   quick help on <command>
npm -l             display usage info for all commands
npm help <term>    search for help on <term>

<product_requirements>
The AI Crypto Trading Coach is an AI-driven system designed to achieve R100,000 monthly profit. Key features include daily strategies, weekly cash-outs, real-time Luno portfolio analysis, robust risk management, and conversational AI. Core functionalities include Google 2FA, AI-driven portfolio/goal analysis, AI web research, concise AI responses, auto-scrolling chat, persistent conversation memory with session forking, targeted trading campaigns, dynamic dashboard updates, and semi-automatic trading requiring user approval. The UI adheres to a black/cyan color scheme, dynamic targets, accurate local timezone timestamps, and full portfolio data without automatic target adjustments. Recent enhancements include Freqtrade-inspired backtesting (simulation mode) and live trading, alongside a fully implemented AI Decision Engine. The current focus is on robust deployment via a standalone Docker package (with transparent AI decision logging, Dry Run/Live Run bot control) and a CI/CD pipeline for VPS deployment. Future plans involve Google Gemini and TikTok integrations.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing critical Docker build failures in the CI/CD pipeline. The initial analysis mentioned  errors and Python  issues for Freqtrade. The AI engineer focused on resolving a specific Unknown command: "error"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help for the frontend Docker build.

The AI diagnosed that the frontend project uses Yarn (evidenced by  and  field in ), but the  was incorrectly using . To fix this, the AI modified  to use yarn install v1.22.22

After this change, the AI performed a local frontend screenshot test, confirming the login page rendered, and a backend  run, which passed all 14 tests, leading the AI to conclude the deployment issue was fixed. However, the user explicitly stated, nope. you did not do anything., indicating the deployment problem persists or the applied fix was insufficient from the user's perspective.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Diagnose and fix the Python  and  errors during Docker image builds for Freqtrade as the overall deployment issue is still considered unresolved by the user.
