<analysis>
The AI engineer, Pieter, was tasked with building an AI/AUTO Trading Bot integrating with Luno, designed to make R1000 daily profit and accumulate generational wealth. The project emphasized robust deployment on a live VPS without affecting existing services, using a detailed framework provided by the user.

The trajectory shows Pieter's systematic approach: initial understanding, research into FreqTrade, comprehensive planning, and incremental implementation. Key challenges involved resolving Python dependencies, correctly configuring Luno API authentication (initially failing with 401 Unauthorized errors), and refining the React frontend UI/UX based on sub-agent feedback. A significant correction involved rectifying FreqTrade's authentication method from username/password to JWT tokens. Pieter successfully delivered a functional backend with Luno integration and a professional React dashboard, including interactive controls and a portfolio view. The current state focuses on generating the complete repository structure for user deployment.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an AI/AUTO Trading Bot integrated with the Luno cryptocurrency exchange. The primary financial goals are to generate a daily profit of R1000 and simultaneously accumulate holdings for long-term generational wealth. The bot should feature an AI-driven strategy, likely leveraging FreqTrade for its integration capabilities with Luno, and include advanced machine learning with adjustable parameters.

Deployment is critical, targeting a live VPS (156.155.253.224) with absolute isolation from existing applications. This involves using dedicated system users, directories, subdomains (), and network ports (Frontend: 3003, Backend: 8004). The application must be containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, with Nginx configured for proxying. Risk management features, including configurable trading allowance, stop-loss/take-profit, and real-time monitoring, are essential. The UI should be a professional dashboard without emojis, providing a portfolio snapshot, real-time market data, and interactive trading controls.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FreqTrade:** Open-source crypto trading bot framework for strategy development and backtesting.
- **FastAPI:** Python web framework for the backend API.
- **React.js:** JavaScript library for building the frontend user interface.
- **Docker/Docker Compose:** Containerization for isolated and consistent deployment.
- **Luno API:** Integration for cryptocurrency exchange operations (trading, balance).
- **MongoDB & Redis:** Database for trade records/analytics and caching respectively.
- **Nginx:** Reverse proxy for routing traffic on the VPS.
- **JWT Authentication:** Used for secure communication with FreqTrade API.
- **AI/Machine Learning:** For price prediction, signal generation, and confidence-based position sizing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured into two main services:  (FastAPI with trading logic) and  (React dashboard), orchestrated by Docker Compose for isolated deployment.



-   ****: The main FastAPI application file, serving as the central API endpoint for the trading bot. It orchestrates communication between the frontend, Luno, FreqTrade, and other internal services. This file was initially set up to connect all components and was modified multiple times to fix API authentication and integrate various modules.
-   ****: Handles all interactions with the Luno API, including fetching account balances and market data. This file was critically important as it initially caused  errors due to incorrect authentication handling, which was subsequently fixed to correctly use Luno API keys and secrets.
-   ****: Manages the interaction with the FreqTrade engine. This file's authentication logic was a major point of correction, as it initially assumed username/password but was updated to correctly use JWT tokens as per FreqTrade's API documentation.
-   ****: Contains the core AI trading strategies that the bot will execute. It defines the logic for market analysis, signal generation, and position sizing.
-   ****: The main React component that renders the entire application dashboard. It was extensively modified to implement the various UI sections (e.g., portfolio summary, market data, controls) and to incorporate UI/UX improvements recommended by BlikSIM, including the removal of emojis and implementation of interactive trading controls.
-   ****: A newly created component to consolidate the professional portfolio dashboard, displaying key metrics, market data, and trading history. This was central to fulfilling the user's request for a clean, professional dashboard without emojis.
-   ****: Defines the multi-service Docker application, orchestrating the  and  services, mapping ports, and setting up dependencies. Essential for local development and production deployment.
-   ****: Provides a template for environment variables, including database credentials, API keys, and trading configuration. It was updated multiple times to include correct FreqTrade JWT secrets and remove erroneous fields.
-   ****: An example Nginx configuration file for proxying frontend and backend traffic on the VPS, following the user's deployment framework.
-   ****: Provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the application to the user's VPS, including server setup, GitHub access, code deployment, and Nginx configuration.

<pending_tasks>
- Further implementation of the Manual Trade and AI Config buttons for their respective functionalities.
- The  service is currently  in the health check, meaning the integration configuration is correct, but the FreqTrade engine itself isn't actively running. This would likely be enabled for live trading.
- Fine-tuning and activation of AI models for live trading.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of generating the complete repository structure with all necessary files (, , , , , , , , , , ) to allow the user to save it to a GitHub repository for deployment.

The application is currently fully functional in the development environment. The backend services (FastAPI, Luno integration, MongoDB, Redis) are running and healthy. The Luno API authentication issue (401 Unauthorized) was successfully resolved, and the balance and market data endpoints are working. The frontend, a professional React-based portfolio dashboard, is also running, displaying key metrics, market data, and interactive trading controls (Start/Stop AI Trading buttons). All emojis and emoticons were removed from the UI as per the user's explicit request. The FreqTrade authentication mechanism was corrected to use JWT tokens, as per its official documentation.

The last completed task was providing a comprehensive list of credentials and deployment commands, which were subsequently corrected for FreqTrade's authentication. The current work is the final step before handing over for user-side deployment, ensuring all codebase files are organized and ready.

<optional_next_step>
Complete the generation of the remaining files for the GitHub repository structure and provide the full codebase to the user for deployment.
