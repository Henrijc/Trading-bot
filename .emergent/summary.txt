<analysis>
The trajectory details the AI engineer's efforts to enhance an AI Crypto Trading Coach MVP. Initially, the focus was on fixing UI inconsistencies (color scheme, tab visibility) and AI responsiveness, which led to the discovery of a Gemini API quota issue. A persistent challenge was a 2-hour timestamp discrepancy. The AI engineer made significant attempts to refactor the frontend's color scheme from amber to black/turquoise across  and , encountering and resolving issues related to Shadcn/ui's CSS custom properties and Tailwind configuration. Authentication functionality was broken and iteratively fixed, with a critical discovery by a troubleshooter that backend API endpoints were registered incorrectly. Concurrently, issues with external access to backend services (Luno data, AI chat) and WebSocket connections emerged, identified as firewall and environment configuration problems. The current state is that backend authentication is fully functional,  styling and tab visibility are addressed, but  colors are still reported as amber by the user, and external access to the backend (port 8001) is blocked by a firewall, preventing full UI functionality. The AI engineer's iterative debugging process, including using  and , was crucial in identifying deep-seated integration and configuration issues.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an AI Crypto Trading Coach aiming for R100,000 monthly profit, featuring daily strategies, weekly cash-outs, real-time Luno portfolio analysis (including staked assets and ZAR conversion), risk management, and conversational AI. The application needs a secure login with Google 2FA and AI-driven portfolio/goal analysis upon login. Key functionalities include AI web research, concise AI responses, auto-scrolling chat, persistent conversation memory via session forking, targeted trading campaigns, dashboard updates for AI-adjusted metrics, daily AI memory consolidation, and semi-automatic trading with user approval. The AI must default to concise responses, display dynamic targets, show accurate local timezone timestamps, and provide full portfolio data without auto-adjusting targets unless explicitly requested. Recent additions include Freqtrade-inspired backtesting with historical data and a simulation mode, and planned live trading. The user explicitly requested a consistent black/turquoise frontend color scheme across the entire application and hinted at future TikTok integration for market indicators.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **External Integrations**: Luno API, Google Gemini (LLM) via , CoinGecko API, DuckDuckGo API, CCXT.
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini, prompt engineering, conversation summarization, rate limit handling.
- **Technical Analysis**:  library, custom Freqtrade-inspired backtesting engine.
- **Security**: JWT, bcrypt, TOTP (), HTTP security headers, CORS.
- **UI/UX**: Shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS.

<code_architecture>


- ****: Stores backend environment variables, including , , , and .
- ****: Defines Pydantic models, notably  for persistent conversation memory.
- ****: Main FastAPI application. Enhanced with chat, backtesting, and live trading endpoints. Includes security middleware and timestamp adjustments to UTC. Logic to save user goals. **Critical update: Authentication endpoints (e.g., ) were moved to be defined *before* their router was included, resolving Not Found errors.** CORS middleware was updated to include the frontend's public IP () in allowed origins.
- ****: Handles AI interactions, including web search, portfolio context, and session management. Fixes applied to use  for consistent timestamps and improved error handling for Gemini API quota (). Processes live trading commands.
- ****: Manages Luno API interactions, expanded to fetch all assets and includes cross-conversion logic (e.g., HBAR to ZAR via USD). Timestamps fixed to use .
- ** (NEW)**: Fetches historical cryptocurrency data using  for backtesting.
- ** (NEW)**: Implements a Freqtrade-inspired backtesting engine.
- ** (NEW)**: Exposes backtesting functionality via API endpoints.
- ** (NEW)**: Manages integration with live trading commands.
- ****: Handles user authentication and 2FA. Credentials are read from environment variables for login validation.
- ****: Updated to include dependencies like , , .
- ****: Main React file, integrates  and .
- ****: Core dashboard component. Contains Fork Session button, dynamic targets, and timestamp display. It now attempts to include the  as a tab. **Underwent extensive modifications to convert all amber color references to cyan and adjusted the  grid layout from  to  to ensure all 7 tabs (including Backtest) are visible.**
- ****: Primary React component for user authentication and 2FA. **Initially problematic with persistent amber colors despite code changes, it was eventually replaced with a user-provided correct version. This version correctly uses form  for API calls to  and consistently applies cyan Tailwind classes. However, its colors are still reported as amber in the UI.**
- ** (NEW)**: React component displaying the backtesting interface, designed with the cyan/turquoise color scheme and includes simulation mode controls. Contains an Auto Backtest button which caused locator conflicts during testing.
- ****: Updated to define new color palettes (black, turquoise, cyan). **Critically, the  section was updated to explicitly define  shades (100-800) to ensure proper compilation with Shadcn/ui's custom property system.**
- ****: Contains global CSS styles. **Modified to define CSS custom properties for the new cyan color palette, enabling Tailwind to correctly use these colors within the Shadcn/ui framework.**
- ** (NEW)**: Created to explicitly define  for production environments ().
- ** (NEW)**: Created to document explicit development guidelines (e.g., no emojis, no breaking code, consult user, test before confirming, no shortcuts).
- ** (NEW)**: Created to provide a detailed diagnostic snapshot of all identified issues for external analysis.

<pending_tasks>
- Frontend: Fix the persistent 2-hour timestamp discrepancy for AI messages in the UI.
- AI Functionality: Implement TikTok integration for social sentiment analysis.
- Frontend: Resolve persistent amber/gold colors on the login page, despite code changes.
- Connectivity: Fix WebSocket connection issues ().
- Environment: Open Port 8001 in the cloud provider's firewall/security group settings to allow external access to the backend.
- AI Chat System: Diagnose Gemini API problems causing timeouts and non-responsiveness.
- Backtest Integration: Verify if Freqtrade integration is fully functional beyond just tab visibility.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the focus was on resolving external access and frontend-backend connectivity issues, specifically Priority 1 as outlined by the user.

The AI engineer's actions included:
1.  **Identifying the Server's Public IP Address**: Successfully retrieved .
2.  **Creating a Production Environment File**: Created  and configured .
3.  **Updating Backend CORS Configuration**: Modified  to add  to the  list in the .
4.  **Rebuilding and Restarting Services**: Performed a production build of the frontend () and restarted both frontend and backend services.

Despite these steps, the current state of the application is:
-   **Backend Connectivity**: The backend is correctly binding to  and is accessible locally (responds with a 404 for invalid endpoints). However, **external access to port 8001 is still blocked**, resulting in timeouts when attempting to curl the public IP. This strongly indicates a cloud provider firewall issue.
-   **Frontend UI Colors**: The login page () is still visually displaying amber/gold colors, despite multiple attempts to update its code and clear CSS caches/rebuild Tailwind. This suggests a deeper CSS compilation or caching problem that has not been resolved.
-   **Core Functionality**: Luno data is not being pulled when viewed externally, and the AI chat system is non-responsive, both likely due to the backend connectivity issues. The authentication flow, while working perfectly at the backend API level, cannot complete successfully from the frontend due to WebSocket connection errors and general connectivity problems to the backend's public IP.

<optional_next_step>
The immediate next step is to inform the user that **port 8001 needs to be opened in their cloud provider's firewall/security group settings** for external access.
