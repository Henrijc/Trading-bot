===============================================================================
DECISION ENGINE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM
===============================================================================

1. MULTI-FACTOR DECISION FRAMEWORK

The Decision Engine evaluates four critical rule sets:

Rule 1: Portfolio Performance vs Targets
- Compares current monthly performance to R8,000 target
- Above target: Favors profit-taking (sell signals)
- Below target: Favors aggressive buying with high confidence
- Dynamic adjustment based on days remaining in month

Rule 2: Signal Quality and Confidence
- Confidence thresholds: >80% very high, >70% high, >60% moderate
- Signal strength weighting: Strong > Medium > Weak
- Combined scoring affects final trade approval
- Minimum 60% confidence required for trade consideration

Rule 3: Risk Management Enforcement
- 4% maximum risk per trade (R6,201 limit)
- 20% maximum portfolio exposure per asset
- Portfolio risk exposure monitoring
- Position size validation and adjustment

Rule 4: Asset-Specific Rules
- XRP Protection: 1,000 XRP reserved for long-term hold
- Major pairs (BTC/ETH) receive stability weighting
- Asset-specific risk adjustments
- Long-term vs short-term position management

2. DECISION OUTCOMES

Possible Decisions:
- APPROVE: Execute trade with recommended amount
- REJECT: Deny trade execution with detailed reasoning
- HOLD: Maintain current position, wait for better conditions
- REDUCE_POSITION: Partial position adjustment

Decision Confidence:
- High Confidence (>70%): Strong alignment across all rule sets
- Medium Confidence (30-70%): Mixed signals, proceed with caution
- Low Confidence (<30%): Conflicting rules, reject or hold

3. REAL-TIME DECISION EXAMPLES

Example 1: XRP Protection (WORKING)
- Input: Sell 500 XRP at 90% confidence
- Decision: REJECT
- Reasoning: "XRP protection: 1000 XRP reserved for long-term hold"
- Risk Assessment: HIGH - Asset protection violation

Example 2: Risk Management (WORKING)
- Input: Large BTC buy exceeding 4% portfolio risk
- Decision: REJECT
- Reasoning: "Trade size exceeds 4% risk limit"
- Recommended Action: Reduce position size

Example 3: Target-Driven Logic (WORKING)
- Portfolio Status: Below monthly target
- High-confidence buy signal: APPROVED with increased weighting
- High-confidence sell signal: REDUCED weighting (need to reach target)
