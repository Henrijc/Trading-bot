# üéØ SAFE PORT CONFIGURATION - NO CONFLICTS

## ‚úÖ **YOUR CRYPTO COACH WILL NOW USE HIGH PORTS:**

```
Frontend:    http://156.155.253.224:19545

MongoDB:     127.0.0.1:19543 (internal only)
Freqtrade:   127.0.0.1:19546 (internal only)
```

## üîç **TO CHECK IF PORTS ARE FREE (Optional):**

```bash
# SSH into your VPS and check
ssh cryptoadmin@156.155.253.224

# Check if any of these ports are in use
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep -E ":19543|:19544|:19545|:19546"
# Should return nothing if all ports are free

# Check what's using common ports
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep -E ":80|:443|:3000|:8001|:8080"
```
